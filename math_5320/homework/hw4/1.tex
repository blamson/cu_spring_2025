\section*{1.}

Briefly describe any advantages of using sufficient, minimally sufficient, and/or complete statistics.

The main advantage is efficiency. Sufficient statistics allow for us to leverage as little of the data as possible to meet our goals. Using sufficient statistics gives us confidence that we haven't lost any crucial information for estimating parameters along the way. When we move down to minimal or complete statistics we have confidence that the statistic we're using is superior to other sufficient statistics. In particular, if we find a complete statistic for our use case we know we can't find something better that is also unbiased.
