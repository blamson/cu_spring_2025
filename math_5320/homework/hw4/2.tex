If you know a statistic is complete, do you automatically know its sampling distribution?

This is an interesting question. In simple terms, the sampling distribution isn't baked into that result. Knowing a statistic is complete doesn't also come with the sampling distribution automatically. It's not like finding an MGF or some other unique identifier of a random variable. That isn't to say the sampling distribution can't be derived from this statistic though. If a complete statistic is, say, $\sum x_i$, one can derive the distribution of the sum. Same for the sample mean, variance, etc. It just isn't provided alongside that completeness result.
