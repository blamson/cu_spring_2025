\subsection*{1.2}

\textbf{Problem:} What is the distinction between a sampling distribution and the broader definition of a probability distribution?

\textbf{Solution:} A probability distribution is concerned with the behavior of individual random variables. Say we roll a single die, how do we expect it to behave? A random sample meanwhile takes that same die and rolls it an arbitrary number of times. It could be 5 times, 50, 5000000. Each individual roll has the properties of a uniform distribution, but how about the group? With the sampling distribution we are concerned about the behavior of these iid random variables in aggregate. How does this group of random variables behave?
