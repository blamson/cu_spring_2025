\noindent\textbf{Problem:} Briefly, in your own words, why is it advantageous to know a statistic's sampling distribution?

\noindent\textbf{Solution:} I can think of one really good reason, comparison. Knowing how a statistic behaves allows us to look at different samples and compare them. If we're going to compare the sample mean weight of two breeds of dog, we can't confidently identify differences if we don't understand the properties of the sample mean like how much it varies. Hypothesis testing only works the way it does because of our knowledge of sampling distributions.
