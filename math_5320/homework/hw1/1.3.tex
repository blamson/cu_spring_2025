\noindent\textbf{Problem:} What is the distinction between the term standard error and the broader definition of standard deviation?

\noindent\textbf{Solution:} Surprisingly, the term \textbf{standard error} doesn't seem to be explicitly mentioned in Casella \& Berger. Thankfully though it's defined in Jay L Devore Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences. According to that text, the standard error of an estimator is its standard deviation. That is, $\sigma_{\hat{\theta}} = \sqrt{V(\hat{\theta})}$ (Devore, 2012). So, in other words, it is the standard deviation of a statistic. While the standard deviation can measure the variability of a sample, the standard error measures the variation of statistic drawn from that sample. So the standard deviation of the sample mean for instance tells us how much the same mean fluctuates. It's used to help us understand how precise our estimator is. The standard error of the sample mean can help us understand how precise its estimation of the population mean is. Note: not how accurate is is, but precise.
