\subsection*{5.3}

Let $X_1, \cdots, X_n$ be iid rvs with continuous cdf $F_X$, and suppose $E[X_i] = \mu$. Define the rvs $Y_1, \cdots, Y_n$ by:

\[
Y_i =
\begin{cases}
	1 & if \; X_i > \mu \\
	0 & if \; X_i \leq \mu
\end{cases}
\]

Find the distribution of $\sum Y_i$

\noindent \textbf{Solution:}

We can think of each $Y_i$ as a bernoulli random variable where the probability of success is based on a value of $X_i$ exceeding the average of $X$.

More formally:

\[Y_i \sim Bern(p=P(X_i > \mu))\]

We're trying to find the distribution of $\sum Y_i$ and thankfully that's not too bad. The sum of bernoulloi rvs is just a binomial. The probability parameter stays the same, but we can change $X_i$ to $X_1$ because our rvs are all iid. 

\[\sum Y_i \sim Bin(n, p=P(X_1 > \mu))\]
