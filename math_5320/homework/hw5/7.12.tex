\section{7.12}

Let \rs be a random sample from a population with pmf

\[
	P_{\theta}(X=x) = \theta^x(1-\theta)^{1-x}, \;\;\; x\in\{0,1\}, \; 0 \leq \theta \leq 1/2
\]

\subsection*{A}

Find the method of moments and MLE of $\theta$

For method of moments, we notice that $x_i \sim Bern(\theta)$. Therefore

\[
	E[X_i] = \theta \equiv \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i
\]

This one just kind of falls straight out of the setup really. So $\hat{\theta}_{\text{MOM}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i$

\noindent For MLE, things get a bit more interesting because of the bound on $\theta$. I'll be borrowing heavily from example 7.2.7 in the book. 

\begin{align*}
	L(\theta \mid \vec{x}) &= \prod_{i=1}^n \theta^{x_i} (1-\theta)^{1-x_i} \\
	&= \theta^{\sum x_i} (1-\theta)^{n - \sum x_i}
\end{align*}

Let $y = \sum x_i$.

\begin{align*}
	LL(\theta \mid \vec{x}) &= y\log(\theta) + (n-y) \log(1-\theta) \\
	\frac{d}{d\theta} LL(\theta \mid \vec{x}) &= \frac{y}{\theta} - \frac{n-y}{1-\theta} = 0 \\
	\frac{y}{\theta} &= \frac{n-y}{1-\theta} \\
	\frac{y}{\theta} \theta(1-\theta) &=  \frac{n-y}{1-\theta} \theta(1-\theta) \\
	y(1-\theta) &= (n-y)\theta \\
	y-y\theta &= n\theta - y\theta \\
	y &= n\theta \\
	\frac{y}{n} &= \theta
\end{align*}

So, our candidate for the MLE is $\hat{\theta} = y/n = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i = \bar{x}$. Or, at least you would think. Important to note here is that we aren't done. We haven't accounted for the bounds on $\theta$. The textbook example only looks at the case when $0 \leq \theta \leq 1$. 

\subsection*{B}

Find the MSE of each of the estimators.

\subsection*{C}

Which estimator is preferred, justify your choice.
