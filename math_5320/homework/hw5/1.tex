In maximum likelihood estimation, what exactly are you maximizing and why is it reasonable to use this maximum as an estimation of a parameter?

Thankfully, it's what it says on the tin. We're maximizing the likelihood function. This is equivalent to maximizing the joint density of a given sample. The parameters here function as random variables with the data fixed, so by maximizing the joint density what we're really doing is finding the estimators of them that make the data most likely. This is, in a non-technical way, why it's a reasonable approach. Given we have some data, what parameter values are the most likely to have produced it? That's all we're doing here.
