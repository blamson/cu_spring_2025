\section{1}

Briefly describe in your own words the purpose of a hypothesis test and how you use your data to conclude whether you will or will not reject the null hypothesis.

\noindent\textbf{Answer:} 

The big thing going on with these tests is we want to gauge the likhelihood of our data given some null hypothesis being true. Say we assume some average weight of a breed of dog, then we collect a lot of data and get a sample average that seems very different. Hypothesis tests give us a way to actually test that difference, to see how big of one it actually is. Is it likely that we got the sample  average we did due to just random chance? What's the probability we actually got that value or a value even more extreme than it? That's what is so powerful about assuming a null distribution, we can directly quantify the probability of values falling in it.

Being able to quantify this uncertainty allows us to draw conclusions about our data. Were we wrong about our assumptions about that dog breed or is it just simple sample variance? Controlling the size or level of the test allows us to control just how much evidence we need to change our mind as well, giving flexibility to tests that have different levels of risk for a false rejection.
