Show that $1/X$ has an $F_{q,p}$ distribution.

\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{X} &= \frac{1}{\frac{U/p}{V/q}} \\
	&= \frac{V/q}{U/p}
\end{align*}

$U$ is independent of $V$ and neither has had any of their properties changed. The numerator and denominator have simply flipped. So,

\begin{align*}
	\frac{U/p}{V/q} &\sim F_{p,q} \\
	\frac{V/q}{U/p} &\sim F_{q,p}
\end{align*}

Thus, $1/X \sim F_{q,p}$.
