Does the CRLB only apply to unbiased estimators of the parameter? Briefly explain.

According to the book my hunch is no. It seems it can be generalized out to biased estimators as well. To quote the book directly ``Although we speak in terms of unbiased estimators, we really are comparing estimators that have the same expected value.''(Casella, Berger, 271). So we compare estimators with the same expected value and use the variance to evaluate their performance.
