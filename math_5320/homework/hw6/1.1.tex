Briefly explain what information the CRLB provides about the class of unbiased estimators of a parameter.

The CRLB provides a theoretical lower bound on the variance on the class of unbiased estimators of a parameter. This information is crucial as it allows us to compare the effectiveness of various unbiased estimators directly. And, if we can find an unbiased estimator that attains the CRLB, we know that we have found the best estimator of the class.
