\section{3.}

The efficiency of an estimator is the ratio of the CRLB to the variance of the estimator. What is the largest possible value of the efficiency for an estimator? Briefly explain.

What this says is that:

\[
	\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{CRLB}}{\crlb}
\]

We know that $\crlb \geq \text{CRLB}$, so this means the numerator will at best be equal to the denominator and otherwise will be smaller than it. Therefore, the largest value this ratio can attain is 1, and that happens when an estimator attains the CRLB.
